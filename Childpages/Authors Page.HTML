<main><p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid black; color: white;">Hi, my name is Andy Munkeskov as you could probably tell. As this is my personal website I wanted to give a little insight into myself, my personal beleifes, opions and activites that I enjoy. First off to list some things im passionate about. Hockey seems like a good place to start. I have loved hockey for as long as I can remember and started to play 12 years ago when I was only three years old. Although I dont play it competivley anymore I still love watching NHL games, especially from my faviorate team the Edmonton Oilers. Another Passion I've had as long as I can remember is video games which I also started to play around 3 years old. While you will see me rave about my personal favorite of the bunch, I love many types of games from too many genres to count. From Shooters, open world survival games, resource managment, sandbox and many more. I also absolutley adore music. With easily my faviorate genres being different types of rock and metal music. Some personal faviorate bands of mine include Green day, AC-DC, Ghost, Bowling for Soup and many others. I'm not religous in any way, though don't have any issues with people who are and or practice it. That's about it from me for now, if your intersted in how I judge and enjoy video games check out the bottom link.</p></main>
