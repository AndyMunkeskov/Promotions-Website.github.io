    <p style="color:blue">Ori and the Blind Forest, out of the 60+ games in my Steam library is the winner. I've come to learn that one of the things I crave with any game I play is style. Im not talking a relastic style, but a game featuring and embracing its own unique style that makes it stand out and be overalll much more creative. If you asked me I wouldn't point to any other game except this one for best style. Featuring gorgeous visuals with beautiful water colour painted backgrounds, mixed with highly detailed enviorments, models and character designs. It blends together to create one of the most visually appealing games I have ever had the pleasure of playing through. But ontop of style I more so love gameplay in my games. At the end of the day a game can look extremly pretty, but end up being a bad game because it focused on style over substance. However this game doesnt do that. The different gameplay mechanics, mixed with a beautiful, almost rpg like progression system for new abilitys and making yourself stronger. It all amounts to a very fun and addicting gameplay loop that never really gets old. Another point is the story. Although its nothing all that execptional, it doesn't really need to be. It only services the rest of the game to have the story be more of a background thing than in your face stopping you for cutscenes every five minutes. Ending off with a little extra point the price is also a steal, especially if you can cop it on a sale. Mix them together and you get the masterpeice of gameplay, visual style and story that is Ori and the Blind Forest.</p>
